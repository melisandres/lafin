	<p>
		Over the decades, many artists, intellectuals, 
		pseudoscientists, and narrautonomists have collaborated
		with Lafin to further the mission. 
	</p>
	<p>
		In writing our history, we observe the ways in which 
		moments stick to their neighbours, with a kind of glue 
		that gets stuck to our archivists' fingers as they 
		pull the moments apart. We also observe the unique way
		in which every time-line stands apart from the natural 
		flow of time, chopping the shapeless into pieces, 
		convinced of the notion that moments can properly be 
		represented by nodes on a two-dimentional surface 
		squished into quasi-unidimentionality.
	</p>
	<p> 
		Time travel is one way to describe the activity of 
		archiving. It is something we approach with some 
		degree of trepidation&mdash;but since it's often
		the only way to catalogue wayward archives, we often
		oblige. 
	</p>
	<p> 
		At Lafin we consider the meeting of ends, the strands 
		of time. On the page, we try to smooth over the gaps 
		and the inconsistencies. In the world, we try to crate 
		the moments that will mark the obvious breaks, that 
		might be welded together in their telling. Join us.
