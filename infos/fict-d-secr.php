			So much is afforded by the guise of fiction&mdash;by the 
			privilege of being sometimes fictional. We work 
			tirelessly in our negotiations, broadening the 
			grey between what is real, and what is not 
			interested in being so. It takes a special finess, 
			to maneuver correctly. We take nothing for 
			granted, as should you.

			It is said that in deviating from fact, it is 
			difficult to keep one's stories straight. But the 
			shapes narratives can fold into are infinite, and 
			origami, amongst other disciplines, is within our 
			sphere of inquiry.

			"Vaughn accused me of being fake, and I suppose he's

		<h4>on deviating from reality:</h4>

			"We interrogate reality because it often feels 
			foreign to us."

			"Immitation is rarely trickery. Usually it's just

			understanding"

			"Meh. Things are what they are."

			"We're the <i>Fictional</i> Institute of Narrative,

		<h4>the <i>literary</i> theory</h4>
		<p>
		What if we were just characters in a novel? We 
		are... but what if we were only that? This isn't 
		about reflecting on the overdone: <i>"What if we are all 
		a simulation?"</i> question. It's a different sort 
		of question, a transformative and creative approach to 
		selfhood&mdash;maybe.... to be fair, we might first have 
		to figure out if there is indeed a selfhood to redefine.

			Someone we love once said, <i>"immitation is [...]
			the act of working through deepening layers of 
			understanding."</i> Reflecting on this, at this 
			particular juncture, is probably our way of saying 
			that we don't quite understand either.
