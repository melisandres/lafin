		<h4>1977</h4>
		<p>In 1977, the board did not meet. James, in a desire 
		to create a virtual meeting place, created a folder
		that was sent to each board member. The folder included: 
		instructions, a topographical map drawn on acetate, 
		and an accompanying text, that read like a screenplay, 
		and was meant to be torn, as per the surviving instructions. </p>

		<h4>recovered instructions:</h4>
		<p>Once out of your front door, listen attentively. If you 
		are not in anyone's way, close your eyes to listen even 
		more carefully. Turn Right, with your eyes open, with the 
		sounds etched in your consciousness.</p>

		<p>We were able to find the instructions and the map. 
		But, sadly, we were unable to find the accompanying text.
		We chose to follow the instructions, and held the fragile 
		acetate over a street map of our home. We therefor attended
		the meeting virtually, more than 40 years later. We created 
		a stand-in for the lost accompanying text: a script-like 
		document translating an imaginary argument about the nature 
		of time. We then invited today's board to join us in the 
		ceremony. Most did.</p>
