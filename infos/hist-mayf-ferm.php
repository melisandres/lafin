		<p>Our 1986 Château Eustache delivers a delicate aroma of 
		crushed sour cherry and wild grape. Its base notes of 
		hazelnuts and crackling kindling are reminiscent of the 
		summer that inspired its creation. With no other 
		vintages&mdash;only one year, one edition&mdash;it was 
		christened after an imagined castle set aflame by Eustace, 
		patron saint of fire-fighters and butt of a running joke 
		on poisonous patronage. We found the field that yielded 
		its grapes in smoldering cinders the day after we picked 
		the vines clean, so we gathered whisps of smoke to add the 
		the barrels.</p>
		<p>Produced at the Paquets' family-owned winery nestled 
		in the French Alps, our pillaged field of wild grapes 
		yielded three barrels. Dispensed by the spoon or glassful,
	 	this elegant pastiche pairs well with critical cases of 
		nostalgia and similar ailments of the soul.</p>

		<h4>Château Eustache</h4>
		<p>If you are ever invited to the Mayfield or Ruggenbaum
		wine cellars, these aren't the first bottles you'll notice.
		They live in a few cases, at the back. They don't get much
		airplay. They haven't aged gracefully, but not terribly 
		either. I'm told they are kept as a kind of existential
		medecine&mdash;a reminder that sometimes things just happen, 
		out in the dispassionate real world, that mirror something 
		internal and profound. In these rare moments, it really feels like 
		there's an intelligence peering through nature and construct,
		into our souls, and tracing out a sign&mdash;in this case, a 
		wine sign. </p>

		<h4>Les Paquets</h4>
		<p>For over three generations, the Paquets have been preparing and 
		distributing wine for special requests&mdash;<i>des vins d'occasion</i>.
		The Paquet winery has specialized in this adaptability, preparing
		and bottling for partners outside of the industry, and preparing, 
		at their leisure, a simple "vin de table," which they do not sell 
		commercially.</p>
