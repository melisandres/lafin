	<p>On the shady patches of sidewalk across from the residency, on the long subway 
	ride towards the Education Wing, through the orange-lit crack in the 
	door behind which Stacey keeps the printing press, in the empty caf√© 
	chair still warm from our gallerist, we write the back pages of Lafin's
	history.</p>
	<p>At Lafin, we feel it is important to pierce small holes in the veil 
	between the professional and the personal, allowing light to 
	spill through. In the warm glow of pin-prick lights, we trace 
	the lines of our journeys.</p>

		<h4>the inbetween</h4>
		<p>In seeking out institutional archives, we are often given a mish 
		mash of incidental memories. Private musings are the colour and 
		vitality of institutional shifts.</p>
		<p>We've decided to archive, however possible, the ephemera... 
		the extra-curricular musings of an institution.</p>
		<p>As with the archives of our programs and projects, these 
		are&mdash;by necessity&mdash;reconstructed from imagination as well
		as memory.</p>
