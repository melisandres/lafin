		<h4>James Knee</h4>
			<p>James Knee died tragically at the tender age of 27, while finishing his PhD in Amsterdam, young wife and three year old child waiting in Brooklyn, New York. His interest in map making tumbled out of its boundaries to infect everything he touched, and filled his world with a sense that there are maps that push beyond the limits of space and into other, deeper realms.</p>
