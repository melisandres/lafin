		<h4>We're taking a pause</h4>
		<p>We're currently in-between things. It's not to say we aren't busy doing things, but at the moment these are secret things. Studio things. quiet and pressing and personal things. Probably embarrassing things. Maybe even things that have nothing to do with art, and make us seem like we care more about all the stupid interruptions than about the art that makes them meaningful.</p>

		<p>If you're also in-between things, start a residency program in your spare bedroom, and see how you like it when people check the website and wonder why you're being a lazy ass.</p>
