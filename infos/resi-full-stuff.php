		<h4>post hoc artist statement</h4>
		<p>I was grateful to not have a lot of stuff--although it did feel like quite a bit when it was all in one place. If I were to make this work now, it might actually have to culminate with a move, whether that was the original intent or not.</p>
		<p>Art doesn't have to be about materialism if it doesn't want to be. But it does take some extra work to move away from that frame of reference. It's difficult to avoid seeing art through the lens of capitalism, and consumerism. The value of objects, the value of labour, the value of cultural artifacts--all these are wrung through the same filter that codifies a day's activities as either <i>productive</i> or <i>unproductive</i>.</p>
		<p>I put my things in a moving truck. I stayed, with my things, in that moving truck. I pondered how easy it would be to relocate. I missed the comfort of my apartment. I counted the days. People came to see my work in the gallery/moving truck/presentation space. People commented on how better to stack my things. I drew diagrams based on peoples suggestions, and reorganized daily. Some people wanted to see inside boxes, sometimes I obliged. Sometimes I gave things away. And when the exhibition was over, I moved everything back into my apartment. But my apartment felt different, like a lemon sliced open with a sharp knife, as opposed to an orange pulled apart with fingernails.</p>

		<h4>residency notes:</h4>
		<p>M. Fullscript sure scratched up that moving truck. But he returned it pristine. How did he do it? I remember him calling me up in the middle of the night to complain about how hot it was, trying to sleep in there. I wasn't far, he'd parked the truck in my neighbourhood that night. I'd given him a key, so that he had access to my building's bathroom. I brought a ladder, and we climbed up to the top, set up his air mattress on the truck roof, and drank wine until the sun came up.</p>

		<h4>Francis Fullscript</h4>
		<p>Born in Rhodes Island, Fullscript studied Fine Arts at Concordia University in Montreal. He went on to exhibit in Charlottetown PEI, and Dawson City Yukon. He works from a hyper-personalized approach to politics, and an emotionally rich dive into precepts of anarchy. </p>
