		<h4>more text about the piece</h4>
		<p>a few words about the curtains</p>
		<p>I stayed at the middle room for a few days, to visit. Conversations outside would whisper their ways into my dreams. The outdoors were alive with late night dealings and bodies trekking secret passage ways, through backyards, over the roof, onto other roofs, into neighbouring windows or balconies.</p>
		<p>MÃ© said that she thought of her apartment as suspended above the neighbourhood activities... but I spent some time thinking about how the apartment held up, above the theatre that surrounded it.</p>

		<h4>a three curtain play</h4>
		<p>Behind the curtain, the draw-string hangs out of the window and interacts with the world outside. The audience stands around the closed curtain until... the show starts.</p>
		<h4>Curtain One: The Left Room faces Gottingen street</h4>
		<p>The drawstring is attached to a car antennae. The car is parked in front of the downstairs local hang-out/convenience store. The car owner comes out of the store yelling to others. He pulls the drawstring, looking into the window at the audience from below.</p>
		<h4>Curtain Two: The Middle Room faces the alleyway</h4>
		<p>The drawstring is attache to a cinderblock. A stranger runs for their life, into the alley, trips on the drawstring, hurriedly gets up, looks back, and continues running into the darkness.</p>
		<h4>Curtain Three: The kitchen faces Joe's roof</h4>
		<p>A man is standing on the roof, two feet from the window. Holding the drawstring in one hand and his trumpet in the other, he pulls the drawstring. A spotlight turns on. He begins playing his trumpet, level to and facing the audience, his trumpet clinking against the window.</p>

		<p>When I make a suit, I see a body in it, before and after it is.</p>
		<p>Suits and props, and a stage. Environments are built around missing pieces... they are built around the repeated conjuring of an absent subject. I am interested in the act of conjuring, the attributes and idealism associated to the conjured, subject... or environment.</p>
		<p>My world is build for ghosts. The connection between idealism, imagination, and hand-made environments is where my activities lie.</p>
