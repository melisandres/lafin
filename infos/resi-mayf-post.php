		<p> On a winter night in 2000, <i>Postmodern Deconstruction of Death in the Hyperreal</i> brought together two artists/lecturers visiting from New York. Anita Beaumont and Frank Mayfield spent a week in Halifax, each preparing a body of work designed to culminate in a shared lecture/presentation.</p>

		<h4>Frank Mayfield</h4>
		<p>Deconstruction is an act of construction.<br>
		Muteness opens its mouth and loses its meaning.<br>
		Emotions explain themselves into and out of existance.<br>
		I reject on principle.<br>
		My work is mute.<br>
		I build for the intellectual pleasure.<br>
		And I destroy for the flavour.</p>
		<h4>Anita Beaumont</h4>
		<p>My life changed drastically after I survived a life-threatening accident in my early twenties. I remember each moment of that day with vivid clarity: my world rushed back to me with all its important pieces in place, but somehow uncomplicated by bull-shit, bathing in a sense of crisp possibility.</p>
		<p>I try to inject that clarity into my work. I combine photography, performance, and ceramics, and use these mediums to pull reality into focus, to peal back the layers and reveal the possibility of each moment to defy expectation and provoke wonder.</p>

		<p><b>The lecture</b></p>
		<p>(Frank)</p>
		<p>Dim the lights.</p>
		<p>Walk slowly, confidently, to the front of the lecture hall.</p>
		<p>Speak clearly.</p>
		<p>Give everyone the chance to leave before locking the doors from the inside (one minute should be enough, be precise&mdash;have a watch).</p>

		<p>Test the door, and thank people for their attention.</p>

		<p><b>slide #1 (fire exit)</b><br>Pour bottled water into a glass, place the glass on a plinth at the front of the auditorium.</p>
		<p><b>slide #2 (your lifeless body in a painting smock, on a studio floor)</b><br>Lift a small bundle of gauze. Speak clearly while unwrapping: <br><i>"Male, mid twenties, caucasian, painter, studio, 3:02pm."</i><br>Place the chilled unwrapped finger on the plinth, by the glass.</p>
		<p><b>slide #3 (your lifeless body in a beige winter coat, on the icy sidewalk)</b><br>Lift a small bundle of gauze. Speak clearly while unwrapping: <br><i>"Female, mid forties, caucasian, art historian, faculty member, front entrance of the college, 3:13pm."</i><br>Place the chilled unwrapped finger on the plinth, by the glass.</p>
		<p><b>slide #4 (your lifeless body in a purple sweater, in a hallway)</b><br>Lift a small bundle of gauze. Speak clearly while unwrapping: <br><i>"Female, early twenties, asian, sculptor, hallway, 3:21pm."</i><br>Place the chilled unwrapped finger on the plinth, by the glass.</p>
		<p><b>slide #5 (your lifeless body wearing a woolen scarf, on a classroom floor)</b><br>Lift a small bundle of gauze. Speak clearly while unwrapping: <br><i>"Male, late forties, non caucasian, drawing professor, classroom, 3:49pm."</i><br>Place the chilled unwrapped finger on the plinth, by the glass.</p>
		<p><b>slide #6 (your lifeless body in a leather coat, on an exterior deck)</b><br>Lift a final bundle of gauze. Speak clearly while unwrapping: <br><i>"Male, early twenties, caucasian, print-maker, deck, 3:57pm."</i><br>Place the chilled unwrapped finger on the plinth, by the glass.</p>

		<p>Sit on a stool by the plinth.</p> 
		<p>Tape your left index finger down against your palm with medical tape.</p> 
		<p>In a calm and steady voice, ask the audience, <i>"How many artists can one kill in an hour?"</i></p>
		<p>***if you are afraid of blood, cover your eyes with a blindfold.***</p>
		<p>Show the audience a needle and thread. Ask them to reunite you with your art. Hold your hand out. Insist.</p>
		<p>Wait.</p>

		<p>(Anita)</p>

		<p>I start by showing a little impatience, and then the faculty liaison steps up, apologizes for time constraints and presents me.</p>

		<p>I set a more light-hearted tone, to clear the air. I begin by speaking about my art practice, and its central themes. My first slide is of an ambulance, and I open by speaking about the sensation of being pulled back from death, how life is a central force within my work.</p>
		
		<p>I ease into explaining the work I have produced in the context of this event and the question that drives me: “How many artists can one revive in an hour?"</p> 

		<p>My slides are portraits, members of the Halifax art community.</p>

		<p>Upon presenting each slide, I discuss the portrait's visual and aesthetic concerns. I then hold up the finger of the revived artist, and I return it to its rightful owner, or someone willing to pass it on to them.</p>

		<p>Once I've returned the last severed finger, I take a sip of water, and one of the artists I've revived stands up, and offers me a bouquet as a thank-you.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p><b>In preparation for the lecture</b></p>
		<p>(Anita)</p>
		<p>A week prior to the lecture, I approach members of the community, and request that they pose for a photo. I explain that the photos will be presented in an upcomming lecture, and I provide different articles of clothing for each portrait. Before snapping each picture, I ask my subject to smile, and look 'happy to be alive'. I then urge them to attend the event.</p>

		<p>(Frank)</p>
		<p>Wear the item of clothing, stand where Anita's subject stood, and let the life drain from you. Anita will snap a photo.</p>
		<p>In the moments prior to the lecture, as the attendees filter in, locate one of Anita's subjects, give them a bouquet, and instruct them to thank Anita publicly as she finishes her presentation.</p>

		<h4>Frank Mayfield</h4>
		<p>Based in Chicago, Frank Mayfield divides her time between theoretical research, art making, and curatorial work. Her practice demonstrates her particular interest in the uncanny. Her methods outline experimental approaches to scientific research, placing a particular emphasis on a structural deconstruction of methodology.</p>
		<p>Frank has published extensively on the theoretical links between pseudoscience and contemporary art making. Over the last 20  years she has curated for, and shown work in, galleries across Europe, North America and Asia. In recent years, Frank has acted as Executive Director for the Centre de Recherches et d’Etudes Nouvelles. She commutes between France and Chicago, from where she oversees Lafin’s research department. </p> 

		<h4>Anita Beaumont</h4>
		<p>Born in Alaska, Anita grew up on uncultivated farmland in the Canadian prairies. In her early years, she briefly toured the country as a child prodigy, playing picolo with the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra. In her early twenties, her aspirations turned to the visual arts, and she attended the Ontario College of Art and Design, where she studied ceramics and new media.</p>
		<p>Now based in New York city, she shares her time equally between her child Monaco, her dog Cindy Lauper, and her studio, where she is currently building a ten foot tall teacup. Her work has been exhibed broadly, and in 1989, she was the recipient of the Benjamin Looper Foundation's prize for emmerging artists.</p>
