		<p> In the winter of 2000, <i>Postmodern Deconstruction of Death in the Hyperreal</i> was a one night event that brought together two artists/lecturers visiting from New York. Anita Beaumont and Frank Mayfield spent a week in Halifax, each preparing a body of work designed to culminate in a shared lecture/presentation.</p>
		<p>The event was open to the public and presented in the Bell Auditorium, at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, Halifax, NS.</p>

		<h4>Frank Mayfield</h4>
		<p>Ismology is a ridiculous term.</p>
		<p>Art history and theory are contributions to a mainly mute language.</p>
		<p>Nothing is changed, our underpinnings of pretending remain understated as our generations tackle deconstruction with pins and needles.</p>
		<p>My work is mute.</p> 
		<p>Ridiculous terms are appropriate in times where none would withhold deconstruction of a more violent nature.</p>
		<p>Ismology is our secret collective science.</p>
		<p>I build closets in my closets.</p>
		<p>But my skeletons are built to scale.</p>

		<h4>recovered notes:</h4>

		<p>The lecture ends with a word from an audience member (summoned quietly before the beginning of the lecture—given the necessary props and simple instructions—: “When Anita is done speaking, would you mind coming to the front, giving her these flowers, and thanking her?”)</p>

		<h4>Frank Mayfield</h4>
		<p>Dim the lights.</p>
		<p>Walk slowly, confidently, to the front of the Lecture Hall.</p>
		<p>Speak clearly.</p>
		<p>Give everyone the chance to leave before locking the doors from the inside (one minute should be enough, be precise verify&mdash;have a watch).</p>
		<p>slide #1 (fire exit): pour bottled water into glass, place glass on pillar.</p>
		<p>slide #2 - slide #6, give stats on each body, despite each being that of the performer --yours--</p>
		<p>--As each slide is presented, reach for the chilled fingers, left wrapped on the pulpit. Unwrap... place by the glass on the pillar--</p>
		<p>#2 male, mid twenties, caucasian, painter, studio, 3:02pm</p>
		<p>#3 female, mid forties, caucasian, possibly art historian, possibly faculty member, front entrance of the college, 3:13pm</p>
		<p>#4 female, early twenties, asian, possibly sculptor, hallway, 3:21pm</p>
		<p>#5 male, late forties, non caucasian, drawing professor, classroom, 3:49pm</p>
		<p>#6 male, early twenties, caucasian, possibly print-maker, deck, 3:57pm</p>



<p>Sit on a stool by the pillar. Tape one of your fingers down with medical tape. 

State your question: "How many artists can one kill in an hour?"

--if you are afraid of blood, cover your eyes with a blind fold--



Ask the audience to reunite you with your art (needle and thread -- Hold your hand out.). Insist. 



Wait.



Anita becomes impatient. The faculty liaison steps up, apologizes for time constraints and presents Anita.



Anita Beaumont 

Anita approached directly the work she produced on the occasion of her visit to Halifax. Revivification being a

central concern within her work and her life, Anita shows slides of an ambulance, and speaks of the phenomena of being

pulled back from death. The question that was of interest to her during her time in Halifax: “How many artists can one

revive in an hour?”. 



Slides are listed off, showing various members of the Halifax art community, who had been asked a week prior to

pause in front of the camera, wearing certain articles of clothing, smiling, and looking happy to be alive. 



These individuals were not explained the nature of the project, but were however urged to attend the upcoming lecture.

At each of these slides, Anita talks about visual concerns and aesthetics, while she restores the fingers of revived artists

to their rightful owner, or someone willing to pass it on to the absent artist.

Her methods outline experimental approaches to scientific research, placing a particular emphasis on a structural deconstruction of methodology and quantitative abnegation.</p>

		<p>Frank has published extensively on the theoretical links between death, science, and contemporary art making. Over the last 20  years she has curated for, and shown work in, galleries across Europe, North America, and Asia.</p>

		<p>Over the last 5 years, Frank has been the Executive Director of the Centre de Recherches et d’Etudes Nouvelles. She commutes between France and Chicago, from where she oversees Lafin’s research department. </p>
