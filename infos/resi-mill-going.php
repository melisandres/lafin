	<p>Every relationship has its own special economy, defined by its unique brand of transactionality. That's why, the protagonist that journeys through a story built from a capitalist framework is also isolated by it, ensconced in predictable relationships, plastic drama, and the tyrany of an economic system that smothers other systems into submission. When economics and poetry can no longer share the stage, the individual is left with the box office hit, five times in a row, blockbuster6, a yawn fest that the protagonist can only engage in as a fraction of himself, the part of himself too tired to vacate... he becomes loneliness incarnate watching the story forever told, because it's the story that made the most money the last time around, and the time before that, the product of a circular narrative/economical darwinian hellscape.</p>

		<p>While a resident at Lafin, Millefeuilles collected simple moments. These were not to be presented in isolation, but rather as sister moments. He grouped them, so that they might imbue each other with meaning. He grouped them by day, but these temporal links developed and mutated into other kinds of pairings, triplings&mdash;connections that might allow a world of possibilities to emmerge between them.</p>

		<h4>Millefeuilles</h4>
		<p>Millefeuilles is a pastry. Born in Vienna, probably&mdash;or France.</p> 
		<p>An artist name chosen for its layers and its messy eating, Millefeuilles, born Isaac Walker, feels the true nature of the artist is dionysian, and must issue from a chaotic and full-bodied engagement with its subject, which should ultimately be life itself: from the delicate and refined to the one pot mash. Every aspect of experience needs to be crushed, crumpled, and squeezing out at the sides while it's still fresh. Every well-constructed argument needs to be pounded with the weight of corporeality, enjoyed with decadance, not as a thing that will remain over generations, but as a thing that has been carefully crafted for the shortest of shelf-lives, which is the true staying-power of most precious things.</p>
