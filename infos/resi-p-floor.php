		<p>In the early 2000's, board member Mélisandre Schofield began hosting informal artist residencies in her home. Although these were not exactly thought of as residencies, and were organized with a fluidity and spontaneity that becomes difficult to maintain over time, this experience shaped what later became <i>the middle room</i> residency, and all its future incarnations.</p>

		<i><p>"Between 1999 and 2003, I was renting short-term, subletting, sharing with roomates, moving a lot, and I felt particularly lucky when the parts of the floor that were mine had a length and a width that could accomodate a small matt where a guest could sleep."</p>
		<p>"Guests were not called residents, and the work they made in the hours that the matt was a vacant heap of sheets and blanket-like clothing was just the stuff we did&mdash;nothing more, nothing less."</p></i>
