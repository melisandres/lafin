		<p>The middle room residency ran from 2003 to 2005, with a short hiatus in 2005 while middle room resident Vincent Applebee used his residency as an opportunity to host a residency of his own&mdash;in the closet. After Vincent and Jeremy finished their work for the closet residency, and returned home, the middle room residency only hosted a few more residents, as Mélisandre packed her belongings and prepared for a move to Toronto. </p>

		<i><p>I squeezed everything at the peripheries of the apartment, and I slept of the floor. I made an empty space in the middle, like there was in the weird novel I was writing in my off hours. I kept the linens clean. I kept the middle room ready for guests who didn't mind my tip toeing through to get from one extremity of the apartment to the other.<br>The residency was a fixture in my life from 2003-2012. Sometimes a room, sometimes a truck, sometimes the whole apartment--when I went on vacation.</p></i>

		<p>It was risky.</p>
		<p>In its early days, the middle room residency's slanted floor seemed new, like the structure had perhaps settled recently and the angle of ascent from the front room to the kitchen might increase day by day. Guests were forwarned that I would have to tip toe through their room to get from one extremity of the apartment to the other.</p>
