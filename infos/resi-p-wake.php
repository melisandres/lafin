	<p>In their early years together, board members Frank and Stacey spent summers on <i>the Wake</i>, a 250 foot sailboat painted banana yellow and leaving ice cream confetti in its wake. They charted the eastern shores of the North Atlantic, all the way up to Newfoundland, devoting their quieter moments to academia and board games. In the lower decks, an extra room with space enough for a cot and a work bench became their guests quarters&mdash;an agreable place for artist friends to join in the adventure while advancing on small-scale artwork.</p>
	<p>In the summer of 1976, on their first full summer trip, they brought their friend Julianna Kotowsky. During her stay, she wrote her first draft of the award-winning <i>Modus Nautica</i>, a novel-length account of their summer together, told from the perspective of the lost tuna that followed them. This was one of the many beginnings of the Lafin residency program. Other writers and artists in residence during its nautical era include: the Ice Cream Barron, Maude Hollenberg, and Bobby Dylan (the food artist).</p>
