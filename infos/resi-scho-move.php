		<h4>Claus Von Something's move</h4>
		<p>In the final days of the middle room residency, Mélisandre, permanent resident and administrator, decided to put together a proposal&mdash;an application to take part in her own residency. Could she be her own artist in residence? She submitted under a pseudonym, to ensure she would not be given special treatment. But as she developped the proposal, it became clear to her that this wasn't about work she was hoping to make, but rather a man she wanted to momentarily take up residence in. Claus Von Something, a character that felt increasingly real to her, and that she proposed as a final resident for the middle room.</p>
		<p>The selection committe saw through her ruse, but happily obliged, since she would be the one who would have to live with such a poorly articulated fictional character.</p>

		<h4>Claus Von Something</h4> <h5>AKA M. Schofield</h5>
		<p>Claus Von Something, née Claus Von Everything, changed his name when he noticed the places he came from and the experiences that had shaped him had whittled away at him. He has come to believe that his becoming is not an additive process, but rather, it is substractive&mdash;a difficult idea to grasp in the context of such a curious man, soaking up knowledge like a sponge, until one considers a sponge: an object riddled with holes, with the soul purpose of sopping up other subtances.</p> 
		<p>Born in Vienna, and year later, again in Texas (but not in a religious sense), Von Something works remotely, as a translator. He also fancies himself a mixed media artist, working with found objects, in a sculptural capacity that always priviledges substractive processes and builds around the importance of negative spaces: spaces, he tells himself, that may one day be able to contain... <i>something&mdash;if not everything</i>.</p>
