		<h4>statement title</h4>
		<p>In the final days of the middle room residency, MÃ©lisandre, permanent resident and administrator, decided to put together a proposal&mdash;an application to take part in her own residency. Could she be her own artist in residence? She submitted under a pseudonym, to ensure she would not be given special treatment. But as she developped the proposal, it became clear to her that this wasn't about work she was hoping to make, but rather work she has hoping to help document. The work of Claus Von Something, a character that felt increasingly real to her, and that she was hoping to meet as a final resident of the middle room.</p>
