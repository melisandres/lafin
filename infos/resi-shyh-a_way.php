		<h4>screaming for a way out</h4>
		<p>The bridge to Prince Edward's Island is almost 13km long, which means that it would take the average person more than two hours to walk off the island. I once spent a fraction of that on a bridge in Brussels. The five minutes it took to sing a song about an old dock... and someone stopped to ask me if I was okay, thinking for sure I was looking for a way out.</p>
