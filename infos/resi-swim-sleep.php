		<p>I don't think there are audiences; I think there are just witnesses, snoops, and small communities who witness and snoop on each other.</p>
		<p>The further isolating our society becomes, the more forbidden our narratives. We are pocketed into distinct categories. Within our demographic ranges there are specifically manufactured narratives to keep us occupied.</p>
		<p>In targeting market audiences, and pushing for the creation of work that treats people as demographics, today's world of publishing is in the trench digging business. Narratives are social unifiers. As the focus and target, they demarcate territories like conquering nations. This is also the case with children and young adult literature. Generational gaps are easily aggravated by the formation of entirely different narrative cultures.</p>
		<p>I'm in the business of forbidden narratives. The kinds of narratives that travel without passports.</p>

		<h4>More about<i>Sleeping with a Monster in the Closet</i></h4>
		<p>I wanted to write something non-generational by using some the the structures that inform the typical children's story, and then slipping in difficult imagery, a dubious narrative flow, and a premise that didn't give a clear moral framework.</p>
		<p>I remember story time as a child, waiting to hear the same story over and over again. I wanted to rebuild that experience, of not being able to remember what comes next... despite having just heard it.</p>
		<p>An experience similar to trying to remember a dream. When I wake-up from a dream, the atmosphere is the only thing that remains crystal clear, and from that atmosphere, I can try to remember the dream, but often find I'm not sure if I'm remembering the dream, or just making parts of it up as I go along. Retelling a dream is reinventing it... dream data is malleable because it comes from a mental state rather than creates it.</p>
		<p>In a similar way, to read a narrative that breaks down cause and effect into a general state of mind, creates a space that calls for reinventing the text continually, instead of remembering the text.</p>

		<h4>Jeremy Swimmer</h4>
			<p>With no formal training, and few preconceptions, Jeremy Swimmer's work stands far from that of the mainstream in cross-generational literature. Jeremy's focus on the role of narrative and the book object within social frameworks pushes him into strange literary backroads.</p>
			<p>Founder and editor of <i>Catch-a-Cold-Press</i>, a do-it-yourself press in the basement of his family's Annapolis Royal summer home. Jeremy publishes short-run editions, in hand crafted binding, with scotch tape, staples, and more refined processes, such as stitch bindings, and hard-cover editions.</p>  
			<p>Jeremy's work spans text, illustration, and the book object. In addition to his expansive collection of self published chap books, Jeremy has published for magazines and small presses in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Montreal.</p>
			<p>***By night, Jeremy works as a security guard at NSCAD University, where studio hallways have given him the alternative education of an intrepid night student.</p>
