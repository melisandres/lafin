	<p>Art in the movies is art for the movies. It benefits from a narrow context. To anyone who knows about the art world, it looks like something made by a novice--probably the director's brother-in-law.</p>

		<h4>artist statement</h4>
		<p>I choose to watch movies, not for the plot, not for the feels, but for the recursive aspect of art looking at art. How does the art, the works that run through like mute characters within the film, reflect something about the piece as a whole. More than a character, rather a microcosm. A world within a world, art within art. </p>
