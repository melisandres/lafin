			While our annual board meetings create a platform to briefly 
			address institutional concerns, our primary interests lay 
			somewhere in the synthesis of narrautonomous practices with
			experiments, images, texts, and etc.    
			<br><br>
			Our collective has been shaped by a few generations
			of renegade intellectuals plotting Oulipo-style realities, 
			'pataphysical expeditions, un-happenings, surveys suspended 
			in time and space. Lafin continues the tradition of being 
			navigated by a board that does whatever the hell it feels 
			like doing.

			Our present board of directors is the heart of Lafin. 
			Meeting in person only once a year, due to the great 
			distances that separate them, they work together closely, 
			sharing writing and research by mail.

		<p>
			Due to the great distances that separate most Lafin 
			members, text is Lafin's primary geographical location. 
			Lafin's text is not limited to print, or to the web, or
			to text for that matter.

			Once a year, Lafin's boad of directors 
			submit their schedules to the scrutiny of a rotating
			peer member, who makes the decision of when, where, 
			and for how long.

			1982's annual meeting infamously took place over a 
			period of three months in a winterized guest house
			 by a Norwegian pond. In 2001, all met at Charles
			de Gaule, during someone's 3 hour layover.

			The details of 2020's meeting are still undisclosed.
