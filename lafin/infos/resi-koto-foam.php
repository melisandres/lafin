	<p><i>Foamed</i> is a journey in which the landmarks take on imagined shapes, and revert into the oceanic mass. Julianna spends months on a small sailboat with a couple, June and August, and the wayward tuna that has taken to following their boat. The tempermental force of the ocean, and the ways in which she feels herself redefined, as a blending of those near her&mdash;July.</p>

		<h4>excerpted from <i>Foamed</i>:</h4>
		<p>Our tuna has a worried gaze that never relaxes, unblinking eyes permanently frozen in apprehension. Every morning, it siddles up to us, almost as big as the boat, it peers in on me in my tiny room. It peers in on me with an unwavering expression, as if something is forever, and desperatly wrong. When it swishes its tail, the boat jostles. When it opens its mouth, the darkness it reveals seems deep enough to swallow the world.</p>
