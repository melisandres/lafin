		<p>While a resident at Lafin, Millefeuilles rummaged through the apartment, and set off on adventures through the streets of Halifax. His goal was to create and collect simple moments, moments he could document later, through drawings and collages. As his journal filled, it became clear to him that these moments were not to be presented in isolation, but rather as sister moments. He grouped them, so that they might imbue each other with meaning. He grouped them by day, but these temporal links developed and mutated into other kinds of pairings, triplings&mdash;connections that might allow a world of possibilities to emmerge between them.</p>

		<h4>Millefeuilles</h4>
		<p>Millefeuilles is a pastry. Born in Vienna, probably&mdash;or else France.</p> 
		<p>An artist name chosen for its layers and its messy eating, Millefeuilles, born Isaac Walker, feels the true nature of the artist is dionysian, and must issue from a chaotic and full-bodied engagement with its subject, which should ultimately be life itself: from the delicate and refined to the one pot mash. Every aspect of experience needs to be crushed, crumpled, and squeezing out at the sides while it's still fresh. Every well-constructed argument needs to be pounded with the weight of corporeality, enjoyed with decadance, not as a thing that will remain over generations, but as a thing that has been carefully crafted for the shortest of shelf-lives, which is the true staying-power of most precious things.</p>
