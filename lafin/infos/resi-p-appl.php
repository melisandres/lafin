		<p>Boy, have the last few months been jam-packed with activity!</p>
		<p>Working hand in hand with the Lafin contingency in Halifax has been a very memorable experience. Here's the last few months in review:</p>
		<h5>January 2005</h5>
		<p>Arrival, unpacking, dinner, outings, integration within the community, compiling applications, organizing viewing facilities, striking a committee of like-minded artist (found at local bars and artist-run centres... also a few house parties and the internet), finally we pick Swimmer (he is a local artist, so my week allotted to making travel arrangements and fund-raising is spent making the middle room habitable for myself, the closet nice and cozy for Swimmer, and cooking some fantastic meals for Mé and her neighbours), planning a "welcome to your closet" party for Swimmer, meeting with a few members of the middle room selection committee to talk about the woes of the world, and the restaurants in London.</p>
		<h5>February 2005</h5>
		<p>Jeremy moves in. We have a few meetings to discuss how the next month and a half are going to go. Jeremy will be working some nights, so I make up a new schedule for myself so that we don't wake each other up, or Mé. I spend time making liaisons with other arts administrators in the city, including the writer's federation of Nova Scotia, finding out about open calls for submissions, and other opportunities I can pass along to Swimmer. Instead, we decided that a reading is our best bet, and I arrange a reading at the Shoe Shop with the Shoe String Series. I also do some in depth research towards writing a good solid essay about the work, once it is finished. Swimmer reaches the final stages of writing and enters the drawing phase of his activities. I point him towards some good studio grit groups, but he seems determined that part of the project is performative, and demand immersion as well as total isolation. Jeremy finishes the drawings, the lay out, and sets off into the printing phase. I drive him around to get supplies (Lucas Dambergs lends me his car).</p>
		<h5>March 2005</h5>
		<p>Our residencies (mine and Swimmer's) turn into a zoo. Swimmer is no longer sleeping or eating. I'm buried in books, some drying from multiple processes Jeremy is inflicting on them, others from my immersion into research mode. Our schedules are more in synch... we eat a meal together in the morning, and Swimmer has taken over the left studio as well, his books wallpapered across the floor. I schedule a few meetings with the press (including <i>The Coast</i>), write some press releases, I trace a pathway through the kitchen to the door and the fridge every night. Jeremy does a reading, I get the essay proof read, layer-out, I work with Mé to make a web version. It's time for Jeremy to move out, but he gave up his apartment when he took the residency, so he stays an extra week while looking for something. I walk on his heals, he steps on my toes, he finds something and leaves. I dismantle the closet, Mé is disappointed, I Fremantle the closet, I clean the apartment thoroughly. Mé and I throw a big party and invite Swimmer. It lasts for three days. I fly back home.</p>

		<p>Vincent Applebee has been active in multiple communities, both in the UK and abroad, as an artist-symbiote.  Working under his name, or others, like a forger, an impersonator, or in anonymity, Applebee has an extensive and secretive exhibition record.</p>
		<p>One-time repetitions, mistakable echos, and situations where the same thing over again is actually something quite different, are parallel branches on which his work swings like a rotten apple.</p>
		<p>Applebee holds a BFA with a major in painting from the Royal Academy in London, works as a copy editor for the Modalis Review, and seldom shows his work under his real name.</p>
