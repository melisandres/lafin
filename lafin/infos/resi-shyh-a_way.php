	<p><i>An insomniac's drawings of shadows on the walls. What happens when God closes a window? What happens when the wind blows through, and messes up all the papers?</i></p>
	<p>While a resident at <i>the floor residency</i>, Shyhorn worked on a scatter of projects. He drew on an array of surfaces, late into the night. During the day and evening, he saught out public and private spaces with interesting acoustics, where he could test out new compositions on small audiences. While working within the residency space, he practiced vocalizations. Unsurprisingly, the theme of his sketches during his residence was <i>escape</i>, which became the theme of the residency host's work during this time as well.</p>

		<h4>screaming for a way out</h4>
		<p>The bridge to Prince Edward's Island is almost 13 km long, which means that it would take the average person more than two hours to walk off the island. I once spent a fraction of that on a bridge in Brussels. In the five minutes it took to sing a song about waiting for a lost love to cross the ocean, I was interrupted by a well-meaning someone who came to ask me if I was okay, thinking for sure I was looking for a way out.</p>

		<h4>Fergus ShyHorn</h4>
			<p>Fergus started his artistic career as a street musician. Although his voice was too quiet to pierce through the noises of the city, he developped a small cult following of curious listeners who would sit on the sidewalk next to him while he busked. One of his fans, in an article for <i>The Coast</i>, described his voice as a thin ribbon rippling through the cacaphonous city.</p> <p>The intimacy created by these performances pushed ShyHorn to further develop increasingly quiet performances that spilled into story-telling and performance art. His performances are designed to create unique moments between himself and very small audiences.</p>
